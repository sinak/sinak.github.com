A few weeks ago Glenn Greenwald's partner, David Miranda, was detained at London Heathrow airport under schedule 7 of the UK's 2000 Terrorism Act.

London's Metropolitan police used the following justification for invoking terrorism laws to detain him:

> "We assess that Miranda is knowingly carrying material, the release of which would endanger people's lives. Additionally <strong>the disclosure or threat of disclosure is designed to influence a government, and is made for the purpose of promoting a political or ideological cause. This therefore falls within the definition of terrorism</strong> and as such we request that the subject is examined under schedule 7."

So a quick guide to being a "terrorist":

1. Find a document that mentions someone by name, and might cause people to dislike that person if it were released publicly. 

2. Consider disclosing that document for the purpose of promoting a political cause.

It's a terrifying example of a government redefining a word to maximize its own power to detain people.

Compare this with NSA Director Keith Alexander's recent comments about PRISM data collection:

> We go through a court order. We issue that court order to them through the FBI. And it’s not millions. It’s thousands of those that are done, and it’s <strong>almost all against terrorism and other things like that</strong>. It has nothing to do with U.S. persons.

As we know now, PRISM's just the start.
