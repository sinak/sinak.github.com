title: Responding to NYT's "The Day The Internet Didn't Fight Back"
category: posts

excerpt:

Last night, New York Times's Nicole Perloth published a post titled "[The Day the Internet Didn’t Fight Back](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/the-day-the-internet-didnt-fight-back/)." It presents Tuesday's protest in a negative light, claiming that it "barely registered."

I'm likely a bit biased as somone who's been working on the campaign for the last month, but the article strikes me as lazy journalism. 

It contains a number of factual inaccuracies which could have been fixed by reaching out to one of the organizers or companies involved. Even after we notified her of the mistakes, only a few of them were fixed in an update made late this evening. You can see a diff of the changes [here](https://github.com/sinak/sinak.github.com/commit/d8050c456337beb73301844904acd95225eec031).


## A list of inaccuracies:
> **"The protest on Tuesday barely registered."**

I'm not sure how 80k calls  and over 500k emails counts as "barely registering." That's not to mention over 400k shares on Facebook, and another 100k on Twitter and Google Plus.

In the lead up to a vote on Amash's bill to defund NSA's call records program about 15,000 calls were made through DefundTheNSA.com. Staffers reported back that their phones were busy throughout the day. 

Given that a total of 400k calls were reported (by systems that don't accurately track calls) during SOPA, Tuesday was at least a fifth of the size of SOPA, and likely greater due to calls we didn't direclty process through our calling system.
<br><br>
> **"Most of those [calls and emails] were directed to Senator Dianne Feinstein."**

I have no idea where she got this from. Feinstein did receive 2420 calls, but saying she received "most" of them is just plain wrong.
<br><br>
> **"Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did nothing to their homepages."**

DuckDuckGo changed their homepage logo yesterday ([screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/117264256@N06/12483506994/in/set-72157640854489604)), and Mozilla added a link and logo on the Firefox start page ([screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/117264256@N06/12468507093/in/set-72157640854489604)), the default homepage shown every time someone opens a new window.

But also: neither were listed as organizers on the site. There were about 40 logos on the domestic site, and another 31 on the international - all groups participating in the day. Perloth assumed they were organizers and didn't send a simple email to fact check.
<br><br>
> **"[Google, Facebook, Linkedin etc] only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner."**

In addition to putting the banner on [reformgovernmentsurveillance.com](http://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/we-need-government-surveillance-reforms/10151876684010766), [Google](http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2014/02/its-time-to-reform-government.html), and [Tumblr](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/76334694062/the-day-we-fight-back) released statements in support, and Twitter tweeted their participation. More on their (limited) involvement below.
<br><br>
> **"On privacy forums and Reddit, significant discussions failed to materialize."**

Over [4,000 comments](http://www.reddit.
com/r/blog/comments/1xm3qu/today_we_fight_back_against_mass_surveillance/) were posted to the reddit blog post that announced their participation and contained the banner. At least another 3,000 comments were  made on [other](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1xl01e/feb_11_is_the_day_we_fight_back_against_nsa/)  [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm761/we_are_the_day_we_fight_back_organizers_ask_us/). 

Is 7,000 comments not significant discussion?

## A more interesting question

It's well-known that defeating a bill is much easier than passing one. The legislative process is easier to block than to move forward and people respond more strongly to a call to defeat a bill. Nevertheless, The Day We Fight Back generated about as fifth as many calls as SOPA.  And it did so without significant participation from companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo.

But why didn't larger tech companies didn't take part? I think that's an interesting question worthy of investigation. 

As they did with SOPA, companies like Google left their decision until the last minute. This time around they decided to support the protest in name, but not actively join. I imagine this is due to a confluence of different factors. Larger tech companies have grown their lobbying presence substantially since 2011. They're playing the inside political game much more so than they did a couple of years ago. They've also banded together on this issue under the "reformgovernmentsurveillance.com" banner. That makes participation a more complicated group decision-making process. And finally, perhaps they simply didn't view this as being the right moment for action. 

But the Internet is not comprised solely of Google, Facebook, et al. To consider an online action solely a success only they join it isn't right. If anything, Tuesday proved that we can take action without their participation. 

David Segal's comment, which Perloth added belated to the article, sums the comparison to SOPA aptly: 

> “To mark all organizing a success or failure by measuring it against the single biggest online activist moment ever is ridiculous.”

## Moving forwards

While we branded yesterday as "the day," this is by no means the end. It's one in a series of actions, a continuation of projects like Stop Watching Us. The actual votes on bills like the USA Freedom Act and FISA Improvements Act are yet to come. 

We made a dent, but challenging the NSA's surveillance apparatus will be a long process.
