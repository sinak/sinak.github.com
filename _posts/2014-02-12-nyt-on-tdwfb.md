tweet: Why the New York Times's article "The Day The Internet Didn't Fight Back" is misleading -> 
excerpt:

Last night, New York Times's Nicole Perloth published a post titled "[The Day the Internet Didn’t Fight Back](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/the-day-the-internet-didnt-fight-back/)." It presents Tuesday's protest in a negative light, claiming that it "barely registered."

I'm biased as someone who's been working on the campaign for the last month, but the article strikes me as a little lazy. It contains factual inaccuracies that would have been easily fixed had she reached out to any of the participants. Even after we notified her of the mistakes, only a few of them were fixed in [an update](https://github.com/sinak/sinak.github.com/commit/d8050c456337beb73301844904acd95225eec031) made late this evening. 

## A list of inaccuracies:
> **"The protest on Tuesday barely registered."**

I'm not sure how 80k calls and over 500k emails counts as "barely registering." That's not to mention over 400k shares on Facebook, and another 100k on Twitter and Google Plus. And over 200 million page views of the banner.

Compare Tuesday with the lead-up to the vote on Rep. Amash's bill to defund NSA's call records program. In two days about 15,000 calls were made through DefundTheNSA.com. Staffers reported back that their phones were busy throughout the day.
<br><br>  
> **"Most of those [calls and emails] were directed to Senator Dianne Feinstein."**

I have no idea where she got this from. Feinstein did receive 2420 calls, but saying she received "most" of them is just plain wrong.
<br><br>
> **"Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did nothing to their homepages."**

DuckDuckGo changed their homepage logo yesterday ([screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/117264256@N06/12483506994/in/set-72157640854489604)). Mozilla added a link and logo on the Firefox start page ([screenshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/117264256@N06/12468507093/in/set-72157640854489604)), the default homepage shown every time someone opens a new window.

But also: neither Mozilla, Duck Duck Go, nor Tumblr were "organizers." They were simply participants. There were about 40 logos on the domestic site, and another 31 on the international - all of groups participating in the day. Perloth assumed they were organizers and didn't send an email to fact check.
<br><br>
> **"On privacy forums and Reddit, significant discussions failed to materialize."**

Over [4,000 comments](http://www.reddit.
com/r/blog/comments/1xm3qu/today_we_fight_back_against_mass_surveillance/) were posted to the reddit blog post that announced their participation and contained the banner. At least another 3,000 comments were  made on [other](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1xl01e/feb_11_is_the_day_we_fight_back_against_nsa/)  [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xm761/we_are_the_day_we_fight_back_organizers_ask_us/). 

Is 7,000 comments not significant discussion?

## Comparing Tuesday to SOPA

David Segal's comment, which Perloth belatedly added to the article, sums up the comparison to SOPA aptly: 

> “To mark all organizing a success or failure by measuring it against the single biggest online activist moment ever is ridiculous.”

But it's also important to note that [Internet Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/) preceded SOPA. ICD happened a full two months earlier than SOPA, and was much smaller than the SOPA blackout. Larger tech companies didn't take part then either.

While we branded yesterday as "the day," this is by no means the end. It's one in a series of actions and a continuation of projects like Stop Watching Us. The actual votes on bills like the USA Freedom Act and FISA Improvements Act are yet to come. 

We made a dent, but challenging the NSA's surveillance apparatus will be a long process.

## On big tech companies' involvement

It's well-known that defeating a proposed law is much easier than passing one. The legislative process is easy to block people respond more strongly when asked to help defeat a bill. Nevertheless, The Day We Fight Back generated a significant number of calls and did so without participation from the larger technology companies.

But why didn't those companies didn't take part?

As was the case with SOPA companies like Google left their decision until the last minute. This time around they decided to support the protest in name but not actively join. I imagine this is due to a confluence of different factors. Perhaps they simply didn't view this as being the right moment for action. Those companies have also grown their lobbying presence substantially since 2011. Perhaps they want to see whether they can push through reform through that route before resorting to a larger action.

But the Internet is not comprised solely of Google, Facebook, et al. To consider an online action successful only when they join is wrong. If anything, Tuesday showed that Internet as a community doesn't rely on big tech companies to make themselves heard.
