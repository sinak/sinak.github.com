Hemingway App makes your writing bold and clear.

I recently received an email from Bing Ads notifying me that our account had been "chosen for a special optimization program." 

I'm all for special optimization. Sounds great, right?

Turns out, not so much. Here's what the program actually involves (emphasis added):

> During the program, our search experts will optimize your keywords, bids and ads using Bing Ads data and insights to help you reach more customers. 

> This program is designed to help you make the most of your campaign budget with no added effort on your part. Although your spend may increase, weâ€™ll make sure that your budget stays exactly as you set it and is not exceeded.

Translation: someone at Bing will review your account and increase your bids and add new keywords until your ad groups are maxing out their daily budget.

The kicker: the program is opt out. Unless you see Bing's email, absorb what their "special optimization program" means, click the link and fill out a form to opt out, they'll automatically adjust your bids.

This seems pretty clearly unethical. 

In case it's not clear why, let me explain a pretty typical ad pricing strategy. Many online ad buyers limit their spend by setting specific max bids on a per-keyword basis. For example, my own company, RepeaterStore, does just this. We set specific bids for keywords like "cell phone signal booster," and those bids determine how much we pay per click, and thus how much we pay in total. Both Bing Ads and Google Adwords have "max daily budget" settings on campaigns and ad groups. But we set a higher daily max budget to make sure we don't lose out on any potential searches, and control spend using our specific keyword bids. 

In other words, our advertising spend is limited by our keyword bids, not by our budgets.  I'm sure many, many other Bing users do the same.

By increasing user's bids to max out their daily budgets, Bing is essentially hijacking our accounts and milking them for every possible dollar.

If you have a Bing account, you can opt out of this program by going to this link.

And if you're doing that, take a minute and tweet @BingAds and let them know you disapprove of this shady tactic. Hell, if you're really mad, stop advertising with Bing.

Here's a screenshot of the email I received:
