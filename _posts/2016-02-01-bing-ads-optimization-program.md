excerpt: Bing Ads's new "Optimization Program" is borderline fraudulent.

I recently received an email from Bing Ads notifying me that our account had been "chosen for a special optimization program."

Here's the email:

<p><a href="/images/bing-email.jpg"><img class="img-repsonsive" src="/images/bing-email.jpg" /></a></p>

I'm all for special optimization. Sounds great, right? 

Turns out, not so much. Here's what's really happening: **Bing Ads is hijacking its customer's accounts and maxing out their daily budgets.**

From their email:

> During the program, our search experts will optimize your keywords, bids and ads using Bing Ads data and insights to help you reach more customers. 

> This program is designed to help you make the most of your campaign budget with no added effort on your part. Although your spend may increase, we’ll make sure that your budget stays exactly as you set it and is not exceeded.

It might be a little hard to read through the marketing BS here, so let me break it down: someone at Bing Ads will review your account and *increase your bids and add new keywords until your ad groups are maxing out their daily budget*.

And here's the kicker:

> If you’d prefer not to participate, please complete [this online form](https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/optout-optimization) before February 5 to opt out.

That's right: the program is *default opt-in*. 

Unless you see Bing's email, absorb what their "special optimization program" means, click the link through to their site and fill out a special form to opt out, they'll assume it's okay to commandeer your account and max out your daily budget.

This seems pretty clearly unethical. 

*Many, many* businesses don't use their max budget to control their ad online ad spend. Instead, they limit their ad spend by setting specific max bids on a per-keyword basis, and set an arbitrarily high max budget to make sure they reach every possible potential customer. 

For example, my own company, [RepeaterStore](https://repeaterstore.com), does just this. We set specific bids for search keywords like "cell phone signal booster," and those bids, along with the number of searches, determine how much we pay in total. We set an arbitrarily higher daily max budget to make sure we don't lose out on any potential searches, and control spend using our specific keyword bids.

By increasing bids to max out their daily budgets, Bing is hijacking customer accounts and milking them for every possible ad dollar.

If you have a Bing account, you can opt out of the program by going to [this link](https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/optout-optimization).

And if you're doing that, take a minute and tweet [@BingAds](https://twitter.com/bingads) or [send them an email](mailto:service@bingads.com) and let them know you disapprove of this shady tactic.
